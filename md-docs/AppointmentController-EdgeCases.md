| - | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | Two users try to **book the same slot** at the same time                       | Only one succeeds, other gets `409 CONFLICT`                 | `/appointments/book`                       | Simulate with multithreaded test               |
| 2 | One thread **books** and another **cancels** the same appointment concurrently | One wins; status reflects final state                        | `/appointments/book`, `/appointments/{id}` | Use synchronized lock or optimistic locking    |
| 3 | One reschedules an appointment while another tries to **arrive** the same      | One fails with `400 BAD_REQUEST`                             | `/appointments/{id}/reschedule`, `/arrive` | State transition validation required           |
| 4 | Admin tries to **block a slot** while a patient is booking it                  | Blocking should fail or vice versa                           | SlotService & `/book`                      | Add atomic operation checks in `SlotService`   |
| 5 | Same patient books 2 different slots at same time                              | Allow only one if same date-time                             | `/book`                                    | Conflict for patient overlapping time          |
| 6 | Reschedule happens **twice in parallel**                                       | Only one should succeed, other should be blocked or rejected | `/reschedule`                              | Use DB transaction isolation or version checks |
| 7 | Arrival and cancel run simultaneously                                          | One should succeed; use transaction to rollback the other    | `/arrive`, `/cancel`                       | Add locking/transactional isolation            |
| 8 | Same slot marked **completed** and **cancelled** in parallel                   | Ensure state consistency                                     | `/complete`, `/cancel`                     | Final state should not be ambiguous            |
